    This was a lot of fun.&nbsp; After making several NeuroEvolution
    'games' I thought I pretty much knew all there was to know. But this
    taught me a few new things, and not just about the 3D programming,
    but about how the Neural Network agent behaves when adding in the
    3rd dimension.<br>
    <br>
    I have 3 versions (well, 4 if you include the human playable
    version).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Neural Network is coded without using a
    library as a set of matrices and a lot of linear algebra to
    calculate the outputs. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; Is like #1, but using the TensorFlow
    library to create Tensors and their built in methods to calculate
    the output (but not explicitly creating a NeuralNetwork Model).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; Uses TensorFlow.js' Layers API to create
    a model and return the output.<br>

    <i>Note: </i><i>(below when I say 'Model code' I mean using the
      Layers API to create a model, and when I say 'Tensor code' I mean
      create Tensors for the weights and use the Tensor methods to
      perform the linear algebra, but not explicitly creating a Model).</i><br>
    <br>
    Oddly enough, this kind of flew in the face of what I learned
    previously; that the TensorFlow model had too much overhead to run
    effectively in the browser.&nbsp; Using the WEBGL renderer seems to
    make a huge difference in performance.&nbsp; However, I still have
    to use a restricted population size in the code with the TensorFlow
    model.&nbsp; The TF model can handle a pop size of around 300 and
    still be smooth and fast enough to run.&nbsp; With that population
    size it can 'solve' the game in around 25-30 generations.<br>
    <br>
    But in the plain code, with no TF, a pop size of 500-750 is easily
    usable, and even 900 runs acceptably.&nbsp; However I found that the
    code that doesn't use any of the TF library functions performs more
    erratically.&nbsp; What I mean by that is that the program will
    'solve' the game sometimes in less than 10 generations and other
    times takes around 40 generation.<br>
    <br>
    The Model code and the Tensor code generally 'solve' the game in
    reliably around 25 generations.<br>

    <font size="+1"><b>How did this project differ from the normal 2D
        ones (car track, dino game, 2d flappy bird, etc)?<br>
        <br>
      </b></font>The one Big Takeaway I got from this project is that
    this type of Neural Network does not like negative numbers as
    inputs.<br>
    <br>
    In this case, the agent's inputs are 1) it's delta X distance to the
    target, 2) the delta Y distance and 3) the delta Z.<br>
    <i>note: (I never use the actual position of the agent as an
      input.&nbsp; This leads the network to 'memorize' the layout of
      the environment instead of reacting to the situations in the
      environment).<br>
      <br>
    </i>I thought that this would suffice, that the network would be
    able to figure out that a negative delta X would mean it has to go
    right to get the delta to near 0, and a positive delta X would mean
    go left until the delta was near 0.&nbsp; But this didn't
    work.&nbsp; It was never able to figure out how to go right, it
    didn't like the negative input.<br>
    <br>
    So I created 2 new boolean inputs, one would be on if the delta X
    was positive and therefore the agent should move right, and the
    other would be on if the delta X was negative.<br>
    I then made the actual delta X input to always be positive by using
    the absolute value of the input.<br>
    Once I did that the program solved the game in 25 generations and
    would reliably solve it every attempt.<br>
