        OK, Autonomous Vehicle is a bit of a stretch, it's a rectangle
        going around a track.&nbsp; But it has sensors, a bit of
        inertia, and it does not know it's location at any point.&nbsp;
        It's only inputs are how close the walls are around it.<br>
        <br>
        The idea here was to create an agent that could move it's way
        around a track.&nbsp; It has no positional input, that would
        lead to memory of the track and that isn't what I was looking
        for.<br>
        The inputs into the agent are raycasted 'sensors' that calculate
        the distance from the agent to the nearest obstacle.&nbsp; There
        are 8 sensors, 1 every 45 degrees around the agent.<br>
        <br>
        Here's what each agent's inputs are like:<br>

          The first goal is to solve the environment, to completely
          circuit the track.<br>
          The second goal is to save the weights of the neural network
          and load them into an agent on another track and see how it
          performs.<br>

              Analysis:</font></b><br>
          <br>
          I initially programmed this in Java using the Processing
          library.&nbsp; I then made a Javascript version to be able to
          be run in a browser.<br>
          Saving/loading the neural network weights in java was simple,
          but accomplishing it in javascript is proving difficult, as
          soon as I can get that accomplished I'll post it here.<br>
          As for now I have linked the Java code in the following gitHub
          link.<br>
          <br>
          As you can see it takes the agent&nbsp; quite a long time to
          figure out how to traverse the course.&nbsp; But once it is
          accomplished the agents neural network is in fact ready to be
          run an an alternate course.<br>
          The link below shows 2 java projects, the one labeled
          'alternate track' is solved immediately after loading the
          agent with the pre-trained model.<br>
          note: the reverse is not true.&nbsp; The alternate track is
          much simpler than the original track, a trained model on the
          simpler track will not immediately solve the original track,
          but it does then solve it quicker.<br>
          <br>
          In a later project I learned that neural networks like this do
          not like negative numbers in their inputs.&nbsp; I had to add
          2 extra inputs, one to say the target is on the left, one to
          say on the right, along with the distance inputs.<br>
          I will try to add a similar approach here to see if the agent
          can perform better.<br>
          As you can see, the agent can complete the first right turns
          relatively quickly, within 5 generations, but then can take
          upward of 30-40 generations to make the next left turn.&nbsp;
          Once it makes the first right turns, the network is heavily
          biased to go right. <br>
          Perhaps I can try giving the agent inputs as to the location
          of the gates.&nbsp; The gates are what gives the agent points
          when traversed.&nbsp; Currently the agent does not see the
          gates, it's only inputs are the distances between the walls
          and the agent.<br>
          <b><font size="+2"><br>
              The big takeaway here:<br>
              <br>
            </font></b>Pre-trained models are powerful.&nbsp; Once the
          agent was trained on the hard course, it easily solved the
          second, simpler, course with no added training needed.&nbsp;
          As you can see, some of the agents even ran the secondary
          course backwards with no difficulty at all.<br>
