    The point of this track is to run a pre-trained model and see how it
    performs.<br>
    Pressing the <b><font size="+1">l</font></b> key (lower case l)
    will load a model trained on the original track.<br>
    After loading you can see that the agents have no difficutly
    completing this track<br>
    even though they have never seen this environment before.<br>
    <br>
    So First if you hit the <b><font size="+2">1 </font></b>it will
    stop drawing all sensors so it can run faster.<br>
    You can also press the <b><font size="+2">c </font></b>key to
    stop/start the camera tracking so you can explore the track.<br>
    Now you can see the agents going around the track.<br>
    <br>
    If you are patient enough they will complete the track usually <b>around


      50 generations.&nbsp; </b>They can solve the environment sooner
    if by random mutation they get lucky.<br>
