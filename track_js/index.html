    So First if you hit the <b><font size="+2">1 </font></b>it will
    stop drawing all sensors so it can run faster.<br>
    Now you can see the agents going around the track.<br>
    <br>
    If you are patient enough they will complete the track usually <b>around

      50 generations.&nbsp; </b>They can solve the environment sooner
    if by random mutation they get lucky.<br>
    Or they can even diverge leading to a never ending cycle.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; Or you can hit the <u><i><font size="+3"><b>L</b></font></i></u>
    <b><font size="+1">key which will load a</font></b> <font size="+2"><b>pre-trained

        model</b></font> and it will instantly be able to solve the
    track.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; As soon as I have time I'll create a new track
    so the pre-trained model can solve it as well with no additional
    training.
