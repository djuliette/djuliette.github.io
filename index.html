    <h1>AI, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning...</h1>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are some of my projects that I've made while teaching myself
      Machine Learning.&nbsp; These are the projects that at least have
      some visual component, mostly games with some sort of
      Neuro-Evolution.&nbsp; Other projects dealing with large data sets
      and predicting values pretty boring to put on a website.&nbsp; But
      I can link to the github code for those as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In each project's page I've put some description and links to the
      code on the P5JS's web editor.&nbsp; I've made several variants of
      each project.&nbsp; Most were originally written in Java or
      Python, but I made Javascript versions so they could be accessible
      in a browser.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Also for each project I have 3 versions, 1 with my own vanilla
      code to create and train the Neural Networks, 1 using Tensors but
      not creating a model (using the tensor's linear algebra functions
      to calculate the weights and outputs), and 1 using the Layers API
      to create a full TensorFlow model.</p>
    <p>SPOILER:&nbsp; the TensorFlow Models actually performed the
      worst.&nbsp; That's just because the model has so much
      functionality built into it, that isn't useful in these simple
      cases, and it slows the program to a crawl.<br>
    </p>
    <p>2 huge influences are Code Bullet and of course Coding Train.<br>

      their way to a goal.

    <p>Here is a link to the Flappy Bird NeuroEvolution code I made
      using Coding Train's and Code Bullet's code as a reference. I've
      made a library of NE code that I've used in several other games.</p>

    <p>Here is a NE of a car going around a track using a Neural Net to
      process it's vision and steer. It takes around 50 generations to
      master the track, but when it does the 'brain' can be saved,
      loaded onto a different track and run perfectly. I'll add the
      'save model' and the alternate track soon. PRESS spacebar to hide
      the sensors and gates to make the program run faster <a
