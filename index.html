<p>AI, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning..</p>
<p>Here is a link to a simple Genetic Algorithm where dots find their way to a goal.

<p>Here is a link to the Flappy Bird NeuroEvolution code I made using Coding Train's and Code Bullet's code as a reference. I've made a library of NE code that I've used in several other games.</p>

<p>Here is a link to Google's Dino runner game using NeuroEvolution

<p>Here is a NE of a car going around a track using a Neural Net to process it's vision and steer.
    It takes around 50 generations to master the track, but when it does the 'brain' can be saved,
    loaded onto a different track and run perfectly.
    I'll add the 'save model' and the alternate track soon.
    PRESS spacebar to hide the sensors and gates to make the program run faster
